## Step1
- Raw data is preprocessed by Wang Ruijue: 
  - outputs are EBITDA_preprocess.csv and revenue_preprocess.csv
  - preprocessing steps are in the root file directory: data_construction.ipynb
## Step2
- The preprocessed data is re-loaded and implement feature engineering by Xu Rui:
  - outputs are EBITDA_new.csv and revenue_new.csv
  - feature engineering steps are in the Cleaned Data file directory: Cleaned Data/EBITDA_preprocessing.ipynb and Cleaned Data/revenue_preprocessing.ipynb
## Step3
- Lin Xiao implemented a benchmark for datasets EBITDA_new.csv and revenue_new.csv
